### What is ADF?
#### Azure Data Factory (ADF) is a cloud integration system, which allows moving data between on-premises and cloud systems as well as scheduling and orchestrating complex data flows. ADF is more of an Extract-and-Load and Transform-and-Load platform rather than a traditional Extract-Transform-and-Load (ETL) platform.
